#SamplyCity

## Simple samples of CityGML 3.0 in the name of simplicity.

- Stage 1 (Progress: %95) : SamplyCity aims to reflect regularly used geometry representations in CityGML 3.0 files.
- Stage 2 (Progress: % 60): SamplyCity aims to consist at least one sample per module.
- Stage 3 (Progress: 30%): SamplyCity aims to reflect all possible data structure scenarios within itself.

## SamplyCity Manifest:

- No decimal coordinates.
- Less vertices as much as possible.
- Hierarchical (GML)ID assignment for all entities. 
- Document the results of the experiments with different software/tools for every file individually.
- Document the possible different behaviours of the software/tools for every file individually.

## A visualization of the most used geometry representations in CityGML 2.0/3.0

This visual is designed to represent the hierarchical data structure of GML geometries reversly (from sub to superb).
