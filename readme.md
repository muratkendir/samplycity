# SamplyCity

## Simple samples of CityGML 3.0 in the name of simplicity.

- Stage 1 (Progress: %95) : SamplyCity aims to reflect regularly used geometry representations in CityGML 3.0 files.
- Stage 2 (Progress: % 60): SamplyCity aims to consist at least one sample per module.
- Stage 3 (Progress: 30%): SamplyCity aims to reflect all possible data structure scenarios within itself. 

## SamplyCity Manifest:

- No decimal coordinates.
- Less vertices as much as possible.
- Hierarchical ID assignment for all entities. 
- Document the results of the experiments with different software/tools for every file individually.
